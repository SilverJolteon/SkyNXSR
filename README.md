# Skyrim Switch Save Renamer

An application that automatically renames Skyrim save files to work on the Nintendo Switch.

## Usage

* Just drag and drop your save file onto the exe.
* It will then prompt you to create a 4 character-long ID to set for your save.
* Afterwards, your newly named save and blank .sav1 file will be in a folder that it generated.
* Place these two files into your saves folder that you backed up with Checkpoint or JKSV.

## Notes

* The ID is used to distinguish between two save files with Characters that share the same name.
* Created for use on Windows.
